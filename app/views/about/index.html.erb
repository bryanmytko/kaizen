<p>Kaizen, japanese for "improvement", has been used to describe a philosophy of continuous, slow improvement. Originally implemented for businesses it also works well as a personal system for making small increases in skills or practices by incrementing at least a small amount each day.</p>

<p>As a life-long learner and teacher I have found that trying to get better works best when there is consistent action spread out over time rather than long sessions of practice separated by days or even weeks, even if those long sessions amount to more actual time. For example, 15 minutes of deliberate practice on a musical instrument per week will advance you much faster than practicing one day a week for 4 hours, even though the latter is more than twice as much actual time.</p>

<p>Comedian <a href="https://twitter.com/seinfeld2000">Jerry Seinfeld</a> once described the way he pressured himself to keep writing comedy. He bought a large wall calendar and marked a red "X" over each day he completed the task of writing. He would watch the chain of X's build up day after day until the only goal then was to simply not break the chain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> is a popular website which is a git repository hosting service that allows programmers to share and collaborate on their projects. One feature of Github which I personally find motivating is the contributions graph. There's a little green box filled in for each day you contribute something, either to your own projects or an open-source codebase. The green box gets darker the more you contribute on that particular day.</p>

<p>I spent a large part of the last few years working on proprietary codebases and when I left that job <a href="http://www.github.com/bryanmytko">all my green boxes</a> went away since I was no longer attached to those repositories. Github has all sorts of rules about what counts as a contribution . This really screwed up my attempts to not "break the chain" by doing a bit of programming every day. So, I decided to build a tool and extract the contributions graph into something users can have to track whatever thing they want to improve on and watch their progress grow over time.</p>

<p>I built this tool for personal use but I hope it provides value for others as well. It's completely free to use and sign up for, and I will not sell your email or whatever other weird things people do with data.</p>
